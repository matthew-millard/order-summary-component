## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Grid template areas
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS Code
- Andy Bell's CSS Reset

### What I learned

- I recently learned how to use grid template areas, so it was awesome to be able to put that into practise in the subscription plan section of the card.

- Experimented with box shadows.

- Used a few pseudo classes for the first time.
  `.annual-plan p:first-of-type {
    text-align: start;
    font-weight: 900;
    grid-area: two;
}`

`.annual-plan p:last-of-type {
    text-align: start;
    grid-area: four;
    color: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
}`

- Used BEM naming convention

### Continued development

- Practise using Grid layouts more to get completely comfortable.
- Develop a better workflow.
- Work against the clock.
